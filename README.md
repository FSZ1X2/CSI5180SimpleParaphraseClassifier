# CSI5180SimpleParaphraseClassifier
The project of simple paraphrase classifier for CSI5180 course

The report for this project is available in this repository:
Module 3 Paraphrase detection ZixunXiang.pdf

The three algorithms are:
AlgoBaseline.py
AlgorithmB.py
AlgorithmBPlus.py

For the last two algorithm:
Note that the weight for each POS is manually set up for testing purpose.
The results are fully depends on the weight for each POS so it might different from the report.
Please change the weight for each POS to what you expect when using the algorithms.
